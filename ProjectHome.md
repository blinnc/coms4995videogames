Pong Revolution is, in short, circular pong. Up to four players will be able to battle it out around a field. Prevent the other team from scoring by blocking their shots, and they will ricoshet off your paddle towards the area outside the circle, giving you a chance to score.

Get ready for arcade-style, pong mayhem action.
